Recent studies on effective learning strategies suggest that spaced repetition is one of the most efficient ways to retain information. By reviewing material at increasing intervals, students can strengthen their memory retention and recall. For example, reviewing notes after one day, then after a week, and then after a month can improve understanding significantly. This technique has become popular among medical and law students aiming to master vast amounts of material.
