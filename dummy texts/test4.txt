My cat has developed an interesting new habit. Every morning, as soon as my alarm rings, she jumps onto my chest and yells at me to get up—louder than any alarm clock. But this morning, I hit snooze, and she stared at me, visibly annoyed. Apparently, hitting snooze is not allowed in her world. I think she’s secretly plotting to get me out of bed even earlier tomorrow
