Last night, I decided to bake cookies for my friend’s birthday. Everything was going fine until I accidentally switched the salt and sugar. When we took a bite, let’s just say the taste was…memorable. My friend couldn’t stop laughing, and now they want to make it a yearly tradition. I told them next time, they’re doing the baking! Lesson learned: always double-check labels before baking anything.
