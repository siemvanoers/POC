A new study on sleep and academic performance has found that students who sleep at least seven hours before exams tend to perform better than those who cram all night. The brain consolidates memories during sleep, making it essential for effective learning. Researchers recommend a balance of study and rest for optimal results. Some students have even reported feeling more alert and confident after following this advice. So next time, try closing the books an hour early!
